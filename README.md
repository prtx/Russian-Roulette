[Russian roulette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_roulette) is a lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against their head, and pulls the trigger. This program imitates the game via command line. If you lose, `sudo rm/*` is executed on your machine.

## Get it
```
$ git clone https://github.com/prtx/Russian-Roulette
```

## How to Play

**Via Host**
```
$ sudo python3 roulette.py --host
```

**Via Client**
```
$ sudo python3 roulette.py --connect [ip]
```

**Bypass `sudo rm/*`**
```
$ sudo python3 roulette.py --host --pussy-mode
```

## Cautions
* Do not attempt on a production server. You might hate your employers. I don't.
* Do not attempt while drunk. You might regret it later when you are sober.

If you end up doing it anyway I'd love to listen. You can catch me @Prt_X.
